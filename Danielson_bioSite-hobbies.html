   <p>Cricut machines are electronic cutting machines that can cut a wide variety of materials such as paper, vinyl, fabric, and even thin metals. These machines work by using a small blade to cut designs that are created using software or pre-designed images.
Cricut machines can be used for a range of projects including scrapbooking, card making, home decor, fashion design, and even personalized gifts. They allow you to create intricate designs with precision and accuracy, giving you the ability to customize your projects to your liking.

Cricut machines can also draw images using a pen tool and score lines for easy folding. With the use of specialized cutting blades, they can also perform unique functions such as engraving, embossing, and perforating.

In addition to cutting and drawing, Cricut machines can also be used to print designs onto materials using a specialized printer attachment. This feature allows for full-color designs to be printed onto a variety of materials, including fabric, without the need for traditional screen printing techniques.

Overall, Cricut machines are versatile tools that provide a wide range of creative possibilities for hobbyists, DIY enthusiasts, and professionals alike.</p>

        <p>As much as Heidi says she loves to just stay at home, she honestly is a person who has a thirst for adventure. On long weekends she loves to travel a few hours away and explore since we have been here in Germany. When in Idaho, we would go camping on long weekends. But since we moved to Germany, she has continued her educational journey and is now on her way to earning a Masters of Nursing in Public Health.</p>
