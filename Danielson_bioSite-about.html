      <h1>About Heidi</h1>
      <p>Heidi Danielson is a registered nurse and a passionate crafter. She always enjoyed working with people and being the caregiver, especially helping children. She realized that she enjoyed science and learning about the mind and body, which led her to pursue a career in nursing. Heidi finds joy in helping others and making a difference in their lives.</p>
<p>In addition to her nursing career, Heidi has developed an interest in crafting and DIY projects. She finds that crafting and DIY projects save her money, and she can make the same things people sell but for half the price. Heidi's proudest accomplishment in her crafting work is making shirts using Heat Transfer Vinyl for her mom's school garden club. The kids loved the shirts, the parents were impressed, and the club felt proud to be able to represent the school with the awesome shirts.</p>
<p>Heidi faced a challenge in her life when her parents divorced, and she had a fear of going to her dad's house or being without her mom. As she grew, she learned how to separate herself from her mom more by getting married and moving out of the country. This did not improve her ability to go to her dad's, but it did teach her that she does not have to be with her mom every day.</p>
<p>Outside of crafting and DIY, Heidi enjoys bike riding or hiking with her family. For someone who wants to start a new crafting or DIY project, Heidi's advice is to plan to spend money upfront but to eventually end up saving the more projects you do.</p>
<p>During her time working as a school nurse, Heidi experienced several memorable moments, but there were a few times when the children did or said things that were funnier than usual. One little girl asked if Heidi had better toilet paper in her nurse bathroom than the school bathroom because the bathroom near her classroom had toilet paper that hurt her bottom.</p>
<p>Balancing work as a nurse with her passion for crafting and DIY, Heidi does not craft as much, and when she does, it is usually during a break. Her biggest influences or role models in life are her mother and her big sister. In the future, Heidi aims to finish her master's degree in nursing with an emphasis on public health and move home to build back her relationship with her family in Idaho.</p>
<p>Heidi's bioSite is a school project website dedicated to showcasing the creative projects and hobbies of my wife Heidi Danielson, a stay-at-home mom and registered nurse with a specialty in school nursing. </p>
<p>On this website, you'll find a brief variety of projects and creations made by Heidi, ranging from personalized shirts to canvas art.</p>
<p>Heidi has always had a passion for crafting and helping others, and she's excited to share her creations with you!</p>
